      <h2>Opening Remarks</h2>
<p>The first thing I would like to get out of the way is that I really do like decentralized technology and I am super stoked about what is going on in the Universe of Decentralized(UoD). Currently I am not so sure where it is going to go, however. It's looking promising, but I guess we'll find out. Anyway, I would like to talk about a few different technologies I've encountered starting with Dat.</p>
<h3>Dat Protocol Doh</h3>
<p>I discovered <a href="" title="https://docs.datproject.org/">Dat</a> not too long ago, but I have read through the documentation and stuff&trade;, and also played around with it.</p>
<p>The gist of what Dat is, as the opening remarks from the docs state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dat is a protocol for sharing data between computers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a good summary of the main functionality of Dat. It is basically the same idea as the Internet or Torrents. The difference here is that it is literally the <em>direct</em> sharing of data between computers. There doesn't need to be a middleman like a server. There is still DNS, which I will get to, but other than that it is a direct connection using Dat. How does this work exactly? Check it out here, it is a technical paper that I am not going to summarize :D</p>
<p><a href="" title="https://datprotocol.github.io/how-dat-works/">How Dat Works</a></p>
<p>Now this sounds all pretty neato, but are there downsides? Probably, but I am not a scientist. I do know of some personal downsides involved with its installation and use though! So the first thing is it is made with Node. I know a lot of people hate Node, but I think it's pretty alright. It can make the web experience much cooler. The thing is it uses npm as the way to install it if you aren't using the installer itself. I <em>hate</em> npm <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. So much. Everything uses so many packages and it makes me sad. Dat uses relatively few, but I did had installation issues with one package on Windows. I think it was something 'gyp'(?). It's been a while, but I am fairly certain it was whatever that one was. You'll see it. </p>
<p>Another problem I had when I first tried using Dat were the DNS servers. For some reason they were just not working correctly that day. The great thing about Dat, however, is the community is super knowledgeable and super helpful. We spent some time going through what the issues may have been on my end, but after a lot of troubleshooting and debug messages we discovered that there was an issues with the servers. It was fixed fairly quickly though. Pretty nice! The main communication happens through IRC and Gitter.</p>
<h4>Applications Using Dat</h4>
<p>The main application that is made to use Dat is the <a href="" title="https://beakerbrowser.com/">Beaker Browser</a>, which is the browser for Dat. It is... okay. It is still under active development, and crashes on Windows a lot. It is pretty easy to use, however. It allows you to set up your puter as a peer for a website, which is necessary for the page to be hosted. Kind of like a Torrent, as I said before. You can also use it to copy websites directly and make your own. A lot of people make their websites that way though; they want you to copy them. Some blogging platforms I found: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="" title="https://github.com/dumblr/dead-lite">dead-lite</a></li>
<li><a href="" title="https://github.com/kodedninja/solo">solo</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I like both of these. They are super easy to use and they look really nice.</p>
<h3>Closing Remarks</h3>
<p>Well I think I will split this blog post up into different posts. Now that I have talked about Dat a bit, I think this is a good place to stop. I will continue with another post sometime in the future about Mastodon and similar softwares.</p>
