      <p>Before this blog, which is a test in and of itself, I have tried many different blogging engines(?). Mainly static site generators. My favorite for a while was Hugo, as it is simple to use and highly customizable. It is completely written in Go which I suppose is pretty neat. I haven't found a static site generator in Python that I have liked, however... Until now! This site is built using <a href="" title="https://darrenmulholland.com/docs/ivy/index.html">Ivy</a>. It is an extremely simple ssg written in Python. It can be installed thusly:</p>
<pre><code class="shell">pip install ivy
</code></pre>

<p>Yup, that's it. I wanted to use Athena originally, which would have been great... If it weren't for all the dependencies. I was fine with pandoc, as it has an installer, but when I had to also install pandoc-sidenote that is when things went downhill. A real bohnah killah. I had to use 'stack', which is fine, but it was just too big of a dependency for me to like it. Also, I had to install virtualenv, which is also fine, but I was already using conda env.</p>
<p>So, anyway, the point is here I am. Using Ivy. Which I highly recommend.</p>
